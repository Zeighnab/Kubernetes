## Scenerio:

You have been given a three-node cluster. Within that cluster, you must perform the following tasks in order to create a service and resolve the DNS names for that service. 
You will create the necessary Kubernetes resources in order to perform this DNS query. 
To adequately complete this hands-on lab, you must have a working deployment, a working service, and be able to record the DNS name of the service within your Kubernetes cluster.

## Task:

* Create and Verify an nginx deployment using the latest nginx image.

* Create and Verify a service from the nginx deployment created in the previous objective.

* Create and Verify a pod that will allow you to perform the DNS query.

* Perform the DNS query to the service created in an earlier objective.

* Record the DNS name of the service.
