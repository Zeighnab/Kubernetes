## Scenerio:

You have been given three nodes, in which you must install the components necessary to build a running Kubernetes cluster. 
Once the cluster has been built and you have verified all nodes are in the ready status, you need to start testing deployments, pods, services, and port forwarding, as well as executing commands from a pod.

## Task:

* Install a three node Kubernetes cluster

* Create a deployment that uses the nginx image

* Expose only one pod on port `8081`

* Verify the NGINX version on the pod

* Create a service for the deployment on port `80`
