## Scenerio:

You have been given access to a three-node cluster. Within that cluster, there are a number of failing pods. You must discover why they aren’t running and repair them as quickly as possible to get them back up and running. Once you’ve applied the fix, verify the pods in the cluster are running and can operate sufficiently. Perform the following tasks in order to complete this hands-on lab:

* Identify the broken pods in your cluster.

* Find out why they are broken.

* Repair them as quickly as you can.

* After applying the fix, verify the pods are running.

* Access the pod directly, install 'wget' utility

* Access the pod directly to ensure the health of the pod.
