## Scenerio:

You have been given access to a three-node cluster. Within that cluster, you must discover the pod that isnâ€™t running as it should. Then, you must collect the logs and save them to a file in order to capture the problematic messages from the log. Perform the following tasks in order to complete this hands-on lab:

## Tasks:

* Identify the pod that is not running in the cluster.

* Collect the logs from the pod and try to identify the problem.

* Output the logs to a file in order to share that file with your colleagues.
